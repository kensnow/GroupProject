# Introduction

Ski-Local is a peer to peer guide service built to offer ski-guiding as a service.  The project is a group effort with the goals of learning and collaboration while building a full MERN stack web App.

## Why Ski-Local?

The Ski-Local concept was to join together skiers who want a 'locals perspective' for exploring ski mountains. 

## Technology Stack

Ski-Local is a full stack web application featuring the MERN stack.  Tech used was:

+ ReactJS
+ NodeJS
+ Express
+ Mongoose
+ MongoDB
+ SASS
+ Axios
+ React Router
+ Bcrypt
+ Express JWT
+ JSON Web Token
+ Multer

Ski-Local features multiple user types, unique users for each schema type, Token based auth and encrypted password storage.

The front End features SASS for styling, built as a Single Page Application using ReactJS and React Router.  The app utilizes Context for data and functionality propogation, and Multer is used for updating profile images for each user object.  

## Learning Project

Ski Local is a learning project to continue to refine skills using the MERN stack to create a full stack web application.  The project also focused on learning group collaboration, version control using git, project management, and communication.
